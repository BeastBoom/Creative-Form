# README - Novell Services Login

## Overview

This project is a **Novell Services Login Form** webpage that features a user-friendly interface allowing users to log in with their credentials and select additional options. The form is styled using a combination of custom CSS and Google Fonts to ensure a clean, modern design. Additionally, images and icons are integrated for an enhanced visual experience.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **index.html**: Contains the structure of the web page, including the login form and other visual elements.
2. **style.css**: The stylesheet for the HTML page that defines the appearance and layout of the elements on the webpage.
3. **Images folder**: Contains all the image assets used in the webpage (e.g., background, icons, and additional graphics).

### External Resources:
- **Google Fonts**: Fonts imported from Google Fonts for a polished typography design.
- **Images**: Custom images used for visual presentation, such as the background, buttons, and social media icons.

## Features

### HTML Form
The form allows users to:
- Input their **username** and **password**.
- Select a **city of employment**.
- Choose a **web server** from a dropdown menu.
- Specify their **role** using radio buttons.
- Opt for **single sign-on services** like Mail, Payroll, and Self-service through checkboxes.

### Styling
- The page layout is styled with **CSS** using Flexbox for responsive and organized alignment.
- The **Pacifico** and **Chakra Petch** fonts are used to create a clean and professional look.
- Hover effects and active states are applied for a better user interaction experience.

### Images
Images are used for:
- Visual presentation: A phone image on the left, icons for LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, and decorative elements like plants and keywords.
- The background image is set to cover the entire page, creating a visually appealing design.

## Files

### 1. index.html
This file is the main HTML document that contains:
- The form elements including input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus.
- Links to external resources (Google Fonts and CSS stylesheet).
- Structural and layout elements such as divisions for arranging the images and form.

### 2. style.css
This file styles the HTML document and includes:
- Flexbox layout for aligning elements (such as form and images) responsively.
- Custom fonts applied to the form and headings.
- Colors, background images, and hover effects for buttons and input fields.
- Margins and paddings for form and elements spacing.

### 3. Images folder

- **plant.png, linkedin.png, instagram.png, twitter.png, keyword.png, flower-shop.png**: Social media icons and decorative images.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The login form and design should load properly, and you can interact with all form elements.

## Notes

- Make sure to link the correct image paths in the HTML file.
- Ensure that `style.css` is in the same directory as the HTML file or adjust the path accordingly.
- The form currently does not have server-side handling for login; it's a front-end layout.

- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom fonts.
- **Images**: For enhancing the visual design.

## Future Enhancements
